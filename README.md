# Spam-Email-Classifier
# Spam Email Classifier using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a Spam Email Classifier built using Python and Machine Learning.  
It classifies messages or emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using text analysis.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Naive Bayes Algorithm

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Public SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- Contains labeled messages: spam and ham

---

## ⚙️ How the Project Works
1. Load the dataset using Pandas
2. Convert text data into numerical form using **TF-IDF**
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train the model using **Naive Bayes**
5. Test the model and calculate accuracy
6. Predict whether a new message is spam or not

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
2. Run the Python file:

---

## ✅ Output
- Displays model accuracy
- Predicts whether a custom message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**

---

## 🎯 Use Case
